# 🏠 Airbnb Clone – Backend Booking Platform

This is the **backend implementation of my Airbnb Clone project**, built to simulate the architecture of a real-world booking platform.  
The project focuses on **backend development, database design, secure API development, and automated workflows** that make the application scalable and production-ready.  

---

## 🚀 Key Backend Features

- 🛠️ **REST & GraphQL APIs** – robust APIs for managing listings, users, bookings, and payments  
- 🏡 **Property Management** – endpoints for creating, updating, and retrieving property listings  
- 📅 **Booking System** – backend logic to handle reservations, availability, and conflicts  
- 👤 **User Authentication** – secure login/signup using JWT and role-based access control  
- 🔐 **Security Best Practices** – input validation, rate limiting, and password hashing  
- 🗄️ **Relational Database** – normalized schema with relationships between users, properties, bookings, and payments  
- ⚡ **CI/CD Integration** – GitHub Actions for linting, testing, and deployment checks  
- 🐳 **Containerized Backend** – Dockerized for consistency across environments  

---

## 🗄️ Database Design

The **MySQL database** schema models real-world Airbnb workflows:

- **Users** – guest, host, and admin roles  
- **Properties** – listings with attributes (location, price, amenities, availability)  
- **Bookings** – reservation records with conflict management  
- **Payments** – transaction data (status, method, amount)  
- **Reviews** – guest feedback for hosts and properties  

This design ensures **data integrity, scalability, and clear entity relationships**.

## 🔧 Development Practices

Throughout this project, I applied backend development best practices:

- 📂 **Repository Management** – structured GitHub repo with modular code organization  
- 🔒 **Security** – JWT authentication, password hashing, request validation, and role-based permissions  
- 🧪 **Testing & CI/CD** – automated pipeline to run tests and enforce code quality  
- 📄 **Documentation** – Markdown docs for endpoints, database schema, and project structure  
- 🐳 **Dockerization** – created containers for consistent dev and test environments

## 🌍 What I Learned

By building this backend, I was able to:

- Gain deep experience with **Django backend architecture**  
- Design and implement a **relational database schema** for real-world workflows  
- Build **secure and scalable APIs** (REST + GraphQL)  
- Implement **CI/CD pipelines** with GitHub Actions  
- Understand how to containerize and manage backend systems with **Docker**
