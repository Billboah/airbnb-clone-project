# 🏠 Airbnb Clone – Backend Booking Platform

This is the **backend implementation of my Airbnb Clone project**, built to simulate the architecture of a real-world booking platform.  
The project focuses on **backend development, database design, secure API development, and automated workflows** that make the application scalable and production-ready.  

---

## ⚡ Feature Breakdown

The backend of the Airbnb Clone was designed around several **core features** that mirror the real-world functionality of a booking platform. Each feature contributes to delivering a secure, reliable, and scalable system.  

### 👤 User Management
Handles **user registration, authentication, and role-based access control** (e.g., guest, host, admin).  
This ensures secure access to the system, enabling different permissions for managing listings, bookings, or admin tasks.  

### 🏡 Property Management
Allows hosts to **create, update, and manage property listings** with details such as price, location, and amenities.  
This feature ensures that the database maintains an accurate catalog of available rentals, forming the foundation of the platform.  

### 📅 Booking System
Implements the **reservation workflow**, including check-in/check-out dates, availability checks, and conflict resolution.  
This feature ensures that two guests cannot book the same property at the same time, maintaining consistency and reliability.  

### 💳 Payment Processing (Simulated)
Provides a **payment flow simulation** to handle transactions for bookings.  
Even though real payment gateways are not integrated, this backend feature demonstrates secure handling of booking and transaction data.  

### 📝 Reviews & Ratings
Enables users to **submit reviews and ratings** for properties and hosts.  
This feature contributes to **trust and transparency** within the platform, simulating the feedback systems found in real-world booking apps.  

### 🔐 API Security
Implements **authentication, authorization, and request validation** using JWT and security best practices.  
This protects sensitive user data, enforces proper permissions, and safeguards against malicious activity.  

### 🔄 CI/CD & Automation
Integrated **GitHub Actions pipelines** for continuous integration and testing.  
This ensures code quality, minimizes errors, and automates deployment workflows for efficiency.

## 🚀 Key Backend Features

- 🛠️ **REST & GraphQL APIs** – robust APIs for managing listings, users, bookings, and payments  
- 🏡 **Property Management** – endpoints for creating, updating, and retrieving property listings  
- 📅 **Booking System** – backend logic to handle reservations, availability, and conflicts  
- 👤 **User Authentication** – secure login/signup using JWT and role-based access control  
- 🔐 **Security Best Practices** – input validation, rate limiting, and password hashing  
- 🗄️ **Relational Database** – normalized schema with relationships between users, properties, bookings, and payments  
- ⚡ **CI/CD Integration** – GitHub Actions for linting, testing, and deployment checks  
- 🐳 **Containerized Backend** – Dockerized for consistency across environments  

---

## 🗄️ Database Design

The **MySQL database** schema models real-world Airbnb workflows:

- **Users** – guest, host, and admin roles  
- **Properties** – listings with attributes (location, price, amenities, availability)  
- **Bookings** – reservation records with conflict management  
- **Payments** – transaction data (status, method, amount)  
- **Reviews** – guest feedback for hosts and properties  

This design ensures **data integrity, scalability, and clear entity relationships**.

## 👥 Team Roles

Even though I worked on this project individually, I approached it as if it were a **real team project**.  
Here are the typical roles that would exist in a backend-focused development team, inspired by industry practices and the ITRexGroup model:  

### 🔹 Backend Developer
- Designs and implements the core application logic.  
- Builds and maintains REST/GraphQL APIs.  
- Ensures business rules are enforced in the backend.  
- Works closely with the Database Administrator to integrate data models.  

### 🔹 Database Administrator (DBA)
- Designs, manages, and optimizes the relational database (MySQL).  
- Ensures data integrity, security, and performance tuning.  
- Maintains backups and disaster recovery plans.  

### 🔹 DevOps / CI/CD Engineer
- Sets up and manages continuous integration and deployment pipelines (GitHub Actions).  
- Automates builds, testing, and deployments.  
- Ensures containerization with Docker and smooth integration with cloud environments.  

### 🔹 Security Engineer
- Implements security best practices in authentication and authorization.  
- Conducts risk assessments and ensures data protection.  
- Monitors for vulnerabilities and applies fixes.  

### 🔹 Project Manager / Scrum Master
- Coordinates tasks, sets milestones, and tracks project progress.  
- Facilitates communication between developers, DBAs, and QA engineers.  
- Ensures the project stays aligned with goals and deadlines.  

### 🔹 Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer
- Writes and executes test cases for API endpoints and business logic.  
- Ensures the backend meets quality standards before deployment.  
- Identifies bugs and collaborates with developers to resolve them.

📝 In this project, I personally covered most of these roles:  
- As a **Backend Developer**, I implemented APIs and core logic.  
- As a **Database Administrator**, I designed and managed the MySQL schema.  
- As a **DevOps Engineer**, I set up GitHub Actions and Dockerized the application.  
- As a **Security Engineer**, I enforced JWT authentication and validation.  
- I also applied **QA practices** by testing endpoints and workflows.

## 🔐 API Security

Security is a **core priority** in this backend project to ensure data integrity, protect user privacy, and maintain trust in the system. The following measures are implemented:

- **Authentication**:  
  Users are authenticated using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**, ensuring that only verified users can access protected resources.  
  🔑 Importance: Prevents unauthorized access and ensures only legitimate users can log in or make bookings.  

- **Authorization**:  
  Role-based access control (e.g., guest, host, admin) restricts access to resources based on user privileges.  
  🔑 Importance: Protects sensitive operations like managing properties or accessing administrative dashboards.  

- **Rate Limiting**:  
  Limits the number of requests per user/IP within a certain timeframe.  
  🔑 Importance: Prevents **brute force attacks** and safeguards against denial-of-service attempts.  

- **Input Validation & Sanitization**:  
  All incoming data is validated and sanitized before being processed.  
  🔑 Importance: Protects the application from **SQL injection, XSS, and other injection attacks**.  

- **Encrypted Communication**:  
  Ensures all data is transmitted over **HTTPS/TLS** for security in transit.  
  🔑 Importance: Protects sensitive data such as passwords and booking/payment details from interception.  

Together, these measures build a **robust defense layer** around the system to ensure safe operations for users, property owners, and administrators.

## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline

To maintain code quality and enable rapid feature delivery, this project leverages a **CI/CD pipeline**.  

- **What is CI/CD?**  
  CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) automates the process of integrating code changes, running tests, and deploying updates.  
  ⚙️ Importance: Ensures every change is tested, secure, and production-ready before reaching users.  

- **Why it matters for this project**:  
  - Automates testing of core backend features (user management, booking, payments).  
  - Reduces the risk of human error during deployment.  
  - Ensures fast, reliable releases for iterative development.  

- **Tools & Technologies**:  
  - **GitHub Actions**: For automated testing and build pipelines.  
  - **Docker**: To containerize the backend for consistent environments.  
  - **(Optional)** AWS/GCP/Azure: For cloud-based deployments and scaling.  

The CI/CD pipeline ensures the backend remains **stable, scalable, and production-ready**, even as new features are added.
